# Reaction Time Game

## Description
This is a simple reaction time game written in C++. The game presents asterisks (*) appearing at random intervals, and the player needs to input the corresponding number within a time limit to score points. Failing to input the correct number within the time limit results in losing the game.

## Features
- Randomized sequence of asterisks to test reaction time.
- Player input required to match asterisk appearance.
- Score tracking and game over conditions.
- Uses sleep function for timing (Note: `dos.h` and `unistd.h` are Unix-based headers; the latter may not be compatible with Windows).

## How to Play
1. Compile the `reaction_time.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Enter your name when prompted.
4. Asterisks will appear randomly, and you need to input the corresponding number quickly.
5. Score points for each correct input.
6. Failing to input the correct number within the time limit ends the game.
7. The final score is displayed at the end of the game.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler
- Standard C++ libraries

## Usage
- Clone or download the repository.
- Compile `reaction_time.cpp` using a C++ compiler.
- Run the compiled executable.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Note
- The game uses platform-specific headers (`dos.h`, `unistd.h`) for timing. Ensure compatibility with your platform.
- This is a simple console-based game intended for educational purposes.
